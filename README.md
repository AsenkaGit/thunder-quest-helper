# Thunder Quest Helper

If you like Final Fantasy X, if you have it on PC with the latest HD remix, if you want to have the Lulu best weapon and if you are lazy then this should be helpful, hopefully !
 
By Launching this small Java program, you can move around the Thunder plain in Final Fantasy X and it will take care of avoiding the lightnings by pressing the key you need at the time you need. Just make sure that the key pressed by this program is the key you configured in game.

Usage :
```
java -jar thunder-quest-helper.jar [--delay=<millis>] [--delay-after-hit=<millis>] [--input-lag=<millis>] [--brightness-threshold=<0..255>] [--key=<key>]
```
